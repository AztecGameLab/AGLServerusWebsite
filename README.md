## Getting Super Powers

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

* Development Tools
  * Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  * Install [Gitkraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
  * Install [Redux Dev Tools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools)
  * Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  * Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

Relevant Plugins for Visual Studio Code

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
